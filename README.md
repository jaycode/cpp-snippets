# cpp-snippets

A collection of C++ snippets I used in my projects. C++ is not Python, it is not straightforward to try out code snippets, so I'd better document them.

To run a snippet:
```
g++ -std=c++14 snippet.cpp -o snippet.out && ./snippet.out
```

Each snippet also has comments documenting their outputs so they can be reviewed directly from Github.
